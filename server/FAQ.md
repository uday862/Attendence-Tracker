### Q12: How is the database structured?
**A:** The database uses MongoDB with these main schemas:
1. **Student Schema**
   ```javascript
   {
     reggNumber: String,
     name: String,
     email: String,
     phoneNumber: String,
     parentName: String,
     parentNumber: String,
     section: String,
     course: String,
     password: String,
     photos: [Buffer]
   }
   ```

2. **Attendance Schema**
   ```javascript
   {
     reggNumber: String,
     name: String,
     section: String,
     attendance: [{
       date: Date,
       periods: [{
         period: String,
