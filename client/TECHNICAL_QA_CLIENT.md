# Client-Side Technical Q&A

## 1. React & Vite Setup

### Q: Why was Vite chosen over Create React App?
A: Vite was chosen for several advantages:
- Faster development server startup
- Quick hot module replacement (HMR)
- Better build performance
- Modern ESM-based development
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Built-in TypeScript support

### Q: How is the development environment configured?
A: The development environment uses:
- Vite for build tooling
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- React 18 for UI framework
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls

## 2. Component Architecture

### Q: How are components organized in the application?
A: Components follow a hierarchical structure:
- Pages: Top-level route components
- Components: Reusable UI elements
- Context: State management providers
- Utils: Helper functions
- Assets: Static resources

### Q: What is the component composition pattern used?
A: The application uses:
- Functional components with hooks
- Compound components for complex UI
- Higher-order components for shared logic
- Custom hooks for reusable state logic

## 3. State Management

### Q: Why use Context API instead of Redux?
A: Context API was chosen because:
- Simpler implementation for the app's needs
- Built into React
- Sufficient for the current state requirements
- Easier to maintain and understand
- Better performance for this scale

### Q: How is state persistence handled?
A: State persistence is managed through:
- Local storage for user preferences
- Session storage for temporary data
- Context providers for global state
- API calls for server state

## 4. Performance Optimization

### Q: What performance optimizations are implemented?
A: The application implements:
- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Memoization with useMemo and useCallback
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Route-based code splitting
- Efficient re-rendering strategies

### Q: How is bundle size optimized?
A: Bundle optimization includes:
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Dynamic imports for route components
- Asset optimization
- Code splitting
- Vendor chunk separation

## 5. Security Measures

### Q: What security measures are implemented on the client side?
A: Security implementations include:
- CSRF token handling
- XSS prevention
- Input sanitization
- Secure cookie handling
- API request validation

### Q: How is authentication handled?
A: Authentication is managed through:
- JWT token storage
- Secure HTTP-only cookies
- Protected route implementation
- Token refresh mechanism
- Session management

## 6. API Integration

### Q: How are API calls structured?
A: API calls are organized using:
- Axios instance configuration
- Centralized API endpoints
- Request/response interceptors
- Error handling middleware
- Authentication headers

### Q: How is error handling implemented?
A: Error handling includes:
- Global error boundary
- API error interceptors
- User-friendly error messages
- Error logging
- Retry mechanisms

## 7. Styling Approach

### Q: What styling methodology is used?
A: The application uses:
- CSS modules for component styles
- Global CSS for common styles
- CSS variables for theming
- Responsive design patterns
- CSS-in-JS for dynamic styles

### Q: How is responsive design implemented?
A: Responsive design is achieved through:
- Mobile-first approach
- CSS media queries
- Flexible layouts
- Responsive images
- Breakpoint system

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Q: What testing approaches are used?
A: Testing includes:
- Unit tests with Jest
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests
- E2E tests with Cypress
- Performance testing

### Q: How is test coverage maintained?
A: Test coverage is maintained through:
- Automated test runs
- Coverage reporting
- CI/CD integration
- Test-driven development
- Regular test maintenance

## 9. Build & Deployment

### Q: How is the build process configured?
A: The build process includes:
- Environment-specific builds
- Asset optimization
- Source map generation
- Bundle analysis
- Performance monitoring

### Q: What deployment strategies are used?
A: Deployment strategies include:
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Environment configuration
- Version control
- Rollback procedures
- Performance monitoring

## 10. Development Workflow

### Q: What development tools are used?
A: Development tools include:
- VS Code with extensions
- Git for version control
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for formatting
- Chrome DevTools

### Q: How is code quality maintained?
A: Code quality is maintained through:
- Code reviews
- Linting rules
- Formatting standards
- Documentation
- Regular refactoring
